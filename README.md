## Production

Project is live at [https://medbook.bogoyavlensky.com/](https://medbook.bogoyavlensky.com/).

- Java 11
- clojure.tools.deps (>= 1.10.3.1040)

```

Now you can run the project inside repl:

(reset)  # run and reset the system;
(stop)  # stop the system;
(cljs-repl)  # run cljs repl
:quit  # quit from cljs repl
(run-all-tests)  # run all test
```

Also, there are some useful make commands: 

```bash
make test  # run tests for api and integration tests ui locally
make lint  # lint project files
make fmt  # format project files
make check-deps  # check outdated deps
make clean  # clean all temp files
make migrations <cmd>  # run migrations commands
```
